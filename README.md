 The kiosk App own futures that disable user intervene, but we need to apply some steps to make it more secure.

1. Enable Developer Mode
 
  On the tablet settings, click Tablet Status and find the Build Number. Click 6-7 times it and congratulations you are the developer. 
 
 2. Install the Application Through Computer.
 
 3. Enable Stay Awake 
 
  After enable Developer Mode, go inside the settings and enable the Stay Awake while charging option.
 
 4. Enable Power On/Off Planning 
 
  On the main settings go to "Power On/Off Planning", you need to enable power on/off mode, so tablet can close while the office is closed. (nights and weekends). We recommend the turn off tablet at 19:00 and turn on 08:00 for only weekdays.
 
 5. Disable Double Tap Lock Button
 
  On the main settings, go to "Screen". Disable the option Called "Disable power button twice camera for Camera"
 
 6. Disable Long Press Home Button
 
  On the main settings, go to "Applications". Find the Google App, disable it and turn it off.
 
 7. Enable Kiosk Specific Settings
 
  On the main settings, go to "Applications". Find the "Room Manager Kiosk". In the settings of application, enable "Home Screen Application" and "Draw over other apps".
  
 8. Change Font Size 
 
  On the main settings, Tap Accessibility, then tap Font size. Make it the smallest one.
  
9. Disable All Notifications

  To keep your phone’s lock screen from lighting up when notifications come in, tap Settings > Display, then toggle off the Ambient Display setting. Or, here's another option: Tap Settings > Sound > Do not disturb > Block visual disturbances, then enable the Block when screen is off setting. Doing so will keep alerts blocked by Do Not Disturb from lighting up your phone's lock screen.

  You can completely turn off notifications for a specific app by tapping Settings > Notifications. Tap an app, then enable the Block all setting. You can also choose to show an app's alerts silently—but remember, even silent notifications can be tempting.
